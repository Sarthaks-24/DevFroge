## Plan: Create `transcribe_vosk.py`

I will create a utility script `transcribe_vosk.py` that uses the Vosk library to transcribe PCM16 16kHz audio chunks. This utility will be designed to handle the audio segments generated by your VAD script.

### Steps
1.  Create `transcribe_vosk.py` with a `VoskTranscriber` class.
    -   **Initialization**: Load the Vosk model from `models/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15`.
    -   **Transcription**: Implement a `transcribe(audio_bytes)` method that creates a `KaldiRecognizer`, processes the audio data, and returns the text result.
2.  Add a `main` block to the script to allow running it from the command line, accepting a WAV file path as an argument for testing.

### Further Considerations
1.  **Model Path**: I will hardcode the default path to `models/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15` but allow it to be overridden.
2.  **Input**: The utility will accept raw bytes (for integration) or a file path (for CLI usage).
3.  **Output**: The script will return the JSON result from Vosk (containing the text).
